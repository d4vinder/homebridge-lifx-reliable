# homebridge-lifx-reliable

A resilient Homebridge bridge for LIFX LAN bulbs and switches.

This is an independent, ground-up TypeScript implementation. Its design was
**inspired by** [`homebridge-lifx-plugin`](https://github.com/calvarium/homebridge-lifx-plugin)
(Apache-2.0); see `NOTICE` and the *Attribution* section below.

## Why this exists

The goal is reliability under real LAN conditions — flaky Wi-Fi, dropped UDP,
and bulbs that occasionally go quiet — without the bridge flapping, bursting the
network, or crashing on one odd device.

## Architecture

```
HomeKit
   │  characteristics (onGet/onSet)
   ▼
accessories/      LightAccessory · SwitchAccessory
   │              └── BaseAccessory: jittered polling + hysteresis offline detection
   ▼
devices/          Light · RelayDevice   (async state model, feature resolution)
   │
   ▼
protocol/         LifxTransport (interface)
   │              └── LanClientTransport  ← swappable: drop in a native LAN protocol here
   ▼
LIFX bulbs (UDP)
```

The entire stack above `protocol/transport.ts` depends only on the
`LifxTransport` interface. The default transport wraps `lifx-lan-client`, but a
dependency-free native protocol can be substituted by implementing that one
interface — no changes to the accessory or device layers.

## Changes from the original (Apache-2.0 §4(b))

- **Async/await throughout.** The original's nested-callback `Init()` flow is
  replaced by promisified device methods with hard per-call timeouts.
- **Strict TypeScript.** `strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`,
  `noImplicitReturns` all on; no `lodash` dependency.
- **Transport abstraction.** Network code is isolated behind `LifxTransport`.
- **Jittered polling.** Each device polls at `interval + random(jitter)` instead
  of a synchronised `setInterval`, avoiding LAN bursts across a fleet.
- **Hysteresis offline detection.** A device is marked *Not Responding* only
  after N *consecutive* failed polls, not a single miss.
- **Consolidated accessory logic.** Offline/online/polling lives once in
  `BaseAccessory` rather than being duplicated across bulb and switch files.
- **Bug fix.** The original `switch.ts` invoked its error fallback without
  `return`, then called the success callback with an undefined value; the
  reimplemented relay path cannot do this.
- **Centralised config defaults** in `resolveConfig`.

## Multizone strips

A multizone strip (LIFX Z / Beam) is exposed as several independent HomeKit
colour lights — one per contiguous range of zones — so sections can be set
separately. The number of segments is configurable via `multizoneSegments`
(default 8); zones are divided into equal segments.

Two extras recreate the LIFX app's signature looks, both on by default:

- **Move** (`multizoneMoveEffect`) — the firmware scrolling animation, exposed
  as a Fan: Active toggles it, the speed slider sets the animation speed, and the
  fan direction selects TOWARDS / AWAY.
- **Themes** (`multizoneThemes`) — momentary switches (Rainbow, Sunset, Ocean,
  Forest, Fire) that paint a palette across the strip. Apply a theme then turn on
  Move for an animated gradient.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g homebridge-lifx-reliable
```

Add the `LifxReliable` platform via the Homebridge UI, or in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    { "platform": "LifxReliable", "name": "LIFX Reliable", "autoDiscover": true }
  ]
}
```

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run build       # tsc -> dist/
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (strict, passes clean)
npm run lint
```
